      description:
        "Can complex code be written creatively? Does art emerge from AI algorithms? How can we teach AI— or about AI—creatively? At MozFest you will have plenty of room to explore these questions in the Creative AI space! By fuelling a community that uses creativity to re-envision, question, and interact with AI and its effects on our daily lives, we will co-create a better future where humans and machines collaborate to unleash the best of us. Collaborative art making, hands-on learning, open studio sessions, critical reflection, forward facing discussions, web-native exhibitions and much more await you in the Creative AI space!",
