Over the summer we were lucky enough to work closely with [Chattanooga Public Library](http://chattlibrary.org/) and other related organisations. The idea - to create and pilot [a customised version of Hyperaudio for organisations](http://hyperaud.io/blog/hyperlocal-hyperaudio).

Sponsorship for this initiative from the [Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/gigabit/) also allowed us to add several features to our private beta and make the core of Hyperaud.io more robust.

The result is a system where organisations can have their very own Hyperaud.io - a version that displays only media and mixes that have been created through their custom hyperaud.io domain. For example [chattanooga.hyperaud.io](chattanooga.hyperaud.io) contains only a [subset](chattanooga.hyperaud.io/media) of the full corpus of hyperaud.io content.

Justin Hoenke - Coordinator of Teen Services at Chattanooga Public Library, was especially active in trying out Hyperaudio with kids not only in Chattanooga but also [in New York](http://justinthelibrarian.com/2014/07/18/thank-you-mozilla-hivenyc-and-the-makerparty-crew/) with Mozilla and HiveNYC as part of the [MakerParty](https://party.webmaker.org/) event.

> HyperAudio and Viditor on The 2nd Floor of the Downtown Chattanooga Public Library offer kids, tweens, and teens in the community a very unique opportunity: the chance to test out a new technology before it goes public. In a way, Chattanooga's youth community are the beta testers for these new tools.

So apart from making the Hyperaudio Pad more robust and allowing customised versions, what other features did we add?

Here's a short list of the main ones:

- Ability to [embed and share](http://hyperaud.io/pad/viewer/?t=XMVjtXOUSC-V0sSZBOKrBw&m=sPT0dvAwSK6hp5aS7acyAg) mixes.
- Support for [Internet Archive hosted material](http://chattanooga.hyperaud.io/pad/viewer/?t=kQV7K2K_Q0a4rteU_7KjkA) in addition to YouTube.
- Improved [Transcript Cleaner](http://hyperaud.io/cleaner/?t=wTrGrulXQSKq0Ny9DLgrRw).
- [Word alignment in Spanish](http://hyperaud.io/pad/viewer/?t=DarWklf8Q1-fhbxaU20FKg), French, German aswell as English.

Thanks to the [Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund](https://blog.mozilla.org/gigabit/) we received the support we needed to get closer to that elusive public beta release, to which I sincerely hope we are now very close. While I'm here, I'd also like to thank [Mark Panaghiston](https://twitter.com/thepag) and [Laurian Gridinoc](https://twitter.com/gridinoc) for going above and far beyond on the development of Hyperaud.io also [Justin Hoenke](https://twitter.com/justinlibrarian) and [Nate Hill](https://twitter.com/natenatenate) for support and organisation on the Chattanooga side of the pond.

Many others have helped - a big thank you to all involved so far!
