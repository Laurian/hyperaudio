Last year, when I was first asked to present Hyperaudio at the [MediaParty in Buenos Aires](http://mediaparty.info), August seemed a very long time away. Yet here we are - I'm Argentina-bound and leaving on a jetplane tomorrow.

I'm excited to be talking about Hyperaudio in a journalistic context and running workshops with the technology we've been working on over the summer. It's set to be a lot of fun.

In preparation I wrote some notes on why Hyperaudio is good for journalism.

## Hyperaudio is Good for Journalism (notes)

Hyperaudio seeks to redefine the relationship between the spoken word, its written form and the media in which it occurs.

Every word of a given piece of audiovisual media is transcribed and time-mapped.

Hyperaudio is good for Journalism for a number of reasons:

**1\. Media is fully searchable and more easily navigated**

- Journalists often acquire a la lot of material.
- Scrubbing through media to locate specific content can be time-consuming.
- Need an easy way to search through that content.

**2\. It becomes easy to edit media**

- Once transcribed media can be edited using basic word processing techniques, drag, drop, copy, paste and delete.
- Scrubbing through media to locate specific content can be time-consuming.
- You can edit media on many devices - you don’t even need to hear the audio to start editing.

**3\. Remixes and iterations feel natural**

- Editing becomes so easy that remixes become as natural as editing text.
- Scrubbing through media to locate specific content can be time-consuming.
- Nothing is thrown away so we can do additive as well as subtractive remixing.

**4\. People can share media in a more granular way**

- Highlight a the text of a piece of media and share that text as long as exact start and stop points of that media.
- Embed remixes in blogs. Allow people to easily remix and blog their perspectives.
- Comment with media.

## Who can Benefit?

**1\. Large news organisations seeking to expose their media content**

- You should transcribe all your media content to make it accessible and searchable.
- Time-code your content and you’re ready for Hyperaudio.
- Hyperaudio.js is MIT licensed and allows you to bring development in-house.

**2\. Citizen journalists seeking a bottom up approach**

- Journalism can come from below.
- Hyperaudio allows you to work together.
- Hyperaudio helps Hyperlocal.

**3\. A new generation seeking media literacy skills**

- Everything is a remix - remix the remix.
- Hyperaudio encourages remixes with ‘view source’.
- Learn from example, teach from example.
- Hyperaudio is fun!

## Addendum - Measurement

When you have word-level timing of content, you can see the content people have clicked upon and/or shared, gaining a better idea of engagement.
